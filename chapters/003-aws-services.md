## AWS Services

AWS offers over 200 services, configurable according to user needs. These services are grouped into several categories, as follows:

- **Compute**: provides tools to develop, deploy, run, and scale applications in the AWS Cloud (e.g. EC2, Lambda, etc.);
- **Containers**: offers services that securely store and manage container images (e.g. ECS, EKS, etc.);
- **Database**: supports all database needs like relational, NoSQL, in-memory, or graph databases (e.g. RDS, DynamoDB, etc.);
- **Developer Tools**: offers services to accelerate the software development process and release cycle (e.g., CodeCommit, CodePipeline, etc.);
- **Management Tools**: includes tools for lifecycle managementâ€”control, environment security, operational efficiency (e.g. CloudWatch, System Manager, etc.);
- **Networking and Content Delivery**: offers solutions for running applications with the highest level of reliability, security, and performance in the AWS Cloud (e.g. VPC, CloudFront, etc.);
- **Security, Identity, and Compliance**: provides tools to achieve compliance and to protect the infrastructure and data from threats and exposures (e.g. IAM, Secrets Manager, etc.);
- **Storage**: offers solutions for storing the data in the AWS Cloud (e.g. S3, EBS, etc.);
- other categories (Analytics, Application Integration, Cost Management, End User Computing, Game Tech, Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Media Services, Migration and Transfer, etc.);

This chapter covers the most popular five services from the category of networking, compute, container, database, and storage, respectively. Each of these services plays an important role in establishing a robust infrastructure.
