## ECR

**ECR** (**E**lastic **C**ointainer **R**egistry) is an AWS managed service, which is used to store container images. It supports:

- Private repositories

- Public repositories (Amazon ECR Public Gallery): https://gallery.ecr.aws/.

The access to the private repositories is controlled through IAM, meaning that only certain users or Amazon EC2 instances can access your container repositories or images.
